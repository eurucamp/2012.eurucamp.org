    Txus is co-founder and lead developer at Codegram, a Ruby/Rails shop based
    in Barcelona, the company behind Barcelona Ruby Conference.

    He's an active member of the Ruby open-source community. Among others he
    has contributed to the Rails framework, RSpec, Rubinius and is the author
    behind many open-source projects at Codegram.

    One of his many passions is understanding the very internals of
    programming languages: compilers and virtual machines, so he usually
    spends a lot of time learning and researching the subject, and building
    his own programming languages and virtual machines.
  talk_title: Polyglot Rails applications with Rubinius
  talk_type: 30min
  talk_summary: |
    Many of us write, maintain and scale Rails applications for a living. And
    we enjoy it because we love Ruby. As developers, we love its expressiveness,
    conciseness, and the freedom and happiness it gives us. But at the same time,
    Rubyists are often attracted to other programming languages and willing to
    learn them: Ruby programmers are often eager polyglots.

    According to the Sapir-Whorf theorem, our thoughts are constrained by our
    language: we think in terms of language. And the more languages we speak,
    and the richer those are, the broader our mental universe becomes.
    In the same way, different programming languages enable us to think
    differently about technical problems.

    What if we could write Rails applications using multiple programming
    languages? Can you imagine different programming paradigms all running
    together in the same application? Passing Ruby, Clojure, Python
    objects back and forth, interacting with each other, within the same VM?

    Fortunately Rubinius, a high-end Ruby implementation, empowers us with
    this possibility. In this talk I'll share my experience with this
    approach and explain a bit about the technical foundations implied.

  talk_title: Do I need DI?
  talk_type: 30min
  talk_summary: |
    There's been much talk in the Rails community lately about more strongly
    object-oriented approaches to design. The argument goes, we should create
    more maintainable applications through modular code, focusing on the
    Single Responsibility Principle, Dependency Injection, and so on. These
    approaches tend to be talked about in quite abstract terms, cited as
    being 'good for testing' or simply 'the right way to do OOP'. But really
    they're just a means to an end: how do you know when one of these
    approaches is good for you?

    In this talk you'll see several examples of the real-world uses of dependency
    injection I've used in my own projects. You'll say how and why DI emerges
    from the program's design goals, how it affects the implementation, and
    what effects it has on the project's structure, and you should gain enough
    understanding to judge when to introduce it in your own work.

  talk_title: Concurrency and distributed systems with JRuby
  talk_type: 30min
  talk_summary: |
    You probably code on a machine with two, if not four, or even eight cores.
    Yet your Ruby application will use only one of them. Concurrency is hard,
    but it’s even harder when you don’t have the environment, or the tools,
    to do it properly.

    JRuby gives you these tools, and so much more. I’ll show you how you can
    use JRuby to write concurrent code, and even distributed systems without
    having to think about threads, locks and the complexity that they cause.

    Running on the JVM is like standing on the shoulders of giants. Why not
    use Akka, an actor framework written in Scala, or Storm, a distributed
    real time computation system written in Clojure? I’ll explain how, and
    show you many more examples on how to use the full power of the JVM from
    the comfort of Ruby.

    aesthetics. In this talk, I'll give an overview of a bunch of interesting
    thinkers, philosophical problems, and how they relate to the worlds of

    One of the biggest challenges when handling big data is making sure your
    system is coherent after an unexpected crash or machine failure. Designing
    your system for idempotency will make sure you can reprocess parts of your
    data to fill in the gaps without accidentally affecting the good data.

    Once you've got the idempotency down, you are free to venture boldly into
    a veritable Narnia<sup>*</sup> of scaling solutions.

    This talk will describe the problem and offer a couple of solutions by
    looking at some real-life implementations.

  talk_title: Clean Docs
  talk_type: 15min
  talk_summary: |
    A lot of the principles of clean code are forgotten when writing
    documentation.

    Have a single source of truth and don't repeat yourself. Avoid writing
    brittle code. Use ubiquitous terminology and choose searchable names.
    Be consistent in your formatting. Test your code. Refactor and practise
    successive refinement. Don't write any more than you need to.

    These principles of clean code can be applied with great effect to the
    production and maintenance of documentation, but there's more to it
    than that. Code needs to satisfy machines and coders. Documentation needs
    to satisfy people who perform a range of different tasks: from cursory
    inspection through to intensive development.

    This talk will review relevant principles and examine real-world examples,
    leaving you with a practical mental checklist for writing documentation
    that will help your users and your software thrive.

  talk_type: 30min
  talk_summary: |
    Object-oriented Ruby is a hot topic in the Rails world and beyond, but it
    is not always the appropriate solution.

    In this talk I discuss various OO techniques, when to use them, and when
    a simpler pattern exists in the functional, declarative, or procedural
    world — including, yes, the Rails framework itself. You will leave knowing
    when to use an aspect instead of a decorator, a mixin instead of a
    presenter, or a monoid instead of a factory.

    Topics will include:

    * The benefits of code coupling.
    * What makes Rails so anti-OO, and why that is good.
    * Testing non-object oriented code.
    * Good uses of classical OO design patterns.
    * How to use a continuation.

  talk_summary: |
    One of the biggest problems in web development today is scalability. It's
    a big problem, and not always easy to solve. The sheer number of requests
    that large applications need to process is huge, and increasing every day.

    One of the most elegant and widely adopted techniques to deal with this is
    favoring distributed architectures over monolithic ones. Having a distributed
    network of tiny apps makes it easier to have a robust, maintainable codebase.
    Adopting the Unix philosophy of doing one thing right is a topic that has
    been coming up at conferences and on blog posts all over the world lately,
    and with good reason.

    But is a distributed architecture always the best solution? Is then a
    monolithic approach "wrong" from the get go? Sometimes building a distributed
    system is worth it, sometimes it just isn't. In this talk I put forward my
    thoughts and experiences dealing with refactoring your application into
    several small ones, how to build a monolithic app that can be easily
    split, how to approach the refactor gradually and incrementally, so as not
    to lose the ability to deliver new features, and how to decide when it's
    simply not worth it.

  talk_title: Ruby on the Command Line
  talk_type: 15min
  talk_summary: |
    Ruby, thanks to its various frameworks, is known to be *the* language
    for web applications – and recent developments in graphic libraries
    make it a worthy contestant in the world of GUI-driven desktop
    programs. But Ruby is also great for writing command-line applications;
    the ability to mix no-boilerplate top-level functions with full-fledged
    OOP means its usage can vary from one-off trivial scripts to
    complicated, option-heavy command-line powerhouses.

    This talk presents the nuts and bolts of writing a command-line
    application with Ruby – from option parsing and accessing standard
    input/output to playing nicely with POSIX standards like exit codes and
    signal/interrupt handling.

    Sebastian is a cofounder of FundExplorer, a Switzerland based Ruby/Rails
    consulting and product shop. He gets a buzz out of cramming as many Ruby
    calculations inside a Rails request as he can.
  talk_title: Complex Calculations Within a Web Request
  talk_type: 30min
  talk_summary: |
    Ruby is slow, so therefore we let complex calculations run outside a web
    request using tools like delayed_job or extract them to C or Java code.
    But what if these two options are not available?

    In the first part of my talk, I will use an example app featuring a
    recommendation algorithm to show you how to load thousands of database
    records and the ins and outs of caching object graphs. In a second part
    of my talk, I'll discuss writing more efficient and faster Ruby code.
