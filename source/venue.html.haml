        This location is recommended if you have a car. It is also accessible
        by public transport, but because this route is not direct and involves
        circumventing the various lakes in the area, it is not particularly
        recommended.
        We can assist by organising a morning/evening shuttle taxi/bus service
        for car-less eurucamp attendees who want to stay at Campingplatz
        Krossinenesee.
