  From the beginning, eurucamp has wanted to be a hands-on kind of experience.
  We're located out in nature, with a [schedule][schedule] that'll let us check
  explore the waters and woods of Berlin.  There's a [fishbowl discussion][fishbowl],
  in which anyone can jump in and take the conversation in a different
  direction.  And, of course, there are the workshops for both beginners and
  advanced developers.

  **Beginners' Workshops**

  We're excited to partner with RailsGirls to provide introductions to Ruby and
  programming.  For more information, [see here][beginners].

  **Advanced Workshops**

  For the experienced Rubyist, we have a number of very exciting options
  lined up.  If you can join us for Friday, take a look at these:

  * _Debugging with Rubinius:_ Dirkjan Bussink will show how Rubinius can allow
  you to debug elegantly.
  * _Rails Routing:_ Matt Patterson will guide us through the intricacies of
  how Rails turns HTTP requests into controller invocations.
  * _Single Page Applications with CoffeeScript:_ Andrzej Krzywda will
  illustrate how to be proud of our frontend code.
  * _Using Joosy:_ Dirk Holzapfel and Sebastian Burkhart will give a hands-on introduction to Joosy, the browser application framework based on Rails and CoffeeScript.
  * _Maintainable CSS with SASS, even in large projects_: Florian Plank will show us the tools for refactoring, structuring and creating better stylesheets.

  The detailed schedule for Friday will be coming out soon.
