  From the beginning, eurucamp has wanted to be a hands-on kind of experience.
  We're located out in nature, with a [schedule][schedule] that'll let us check
  explore the waters and woods of Berlin.  There's a [fishbowl discussion][fishbowl],
  in which anyone can jump in and take the conversation in a different
  direction.  And, of course, there are the workshops for both beginners and
  advanced developers.

  **Beginners Workshops**

  We're excited to partner with RailsGirls to provide introductions to Ruby and
  programming.  For more information, see [here][here].

  **Advanced Workshops**

  For the experienced Rubyist, we have a number of very exciting options
  lined up.  If you can join us for Friday, take a look at these:

  * _Debugging with Rubinius:_ Dirkjan Bussink will show how Rubinius can allow
  you to debug elegantly.
  * _Rails Routing:_ Matt Patterson will guide us through the intricacies of
  how Rails turns HTTP requests into controller invocations.
  * _Single Page Applications with CoffeeScript:_ Andrzej Krzywda will
  illustrate how to be proud of our frontend code.
  * _What is Functional Programming?:_  Emily Green covers what exactly the
  term means and how to apply it to software development with Ruby.
  * BITCROWD WORKSHOP
  * Florian - CSS

  The detailed schedule for Friday will be coming out soon.
