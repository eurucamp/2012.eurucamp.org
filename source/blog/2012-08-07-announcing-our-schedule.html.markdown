  Over the last few months, we've been working hard to put together the best
  conference the wilderness near Berlin has ever seen.  Personally, I think
  we've succeeded -- judge for yourself.

  * Steve Klabnik of Hackety Hack fame will be giving our keynote Friday night
  on [Development and
  Philosophy][klabnik].
  * Lunch Saturday is *five hours long* -- take a boat out on the water, hike or
  bike around the lakeshore, hit up a brewery or take a nap.  The venue is an
  amazing piece of nature, and it's all yours to enjoy with your fellow
  eurucampers.
  * Sunday morning there'll be a [Fishbowl Discussion][fishbowl], giving
  everyone a chance to take part in a wide-ranging, eclectic group
  conversation.
  * And that's in addition to [our talks][speakers]: a wide and talented group of 18 speakers, talking on
  subjects as diverse as multiple languages in Rubinius, RubyMotion,
  dependency injection, Rails engines, concurrency, complex calculation,
  the love it takes to be a developer, and and a lot more.

  Take a look at our [schedule page][schedule] for the full details!
