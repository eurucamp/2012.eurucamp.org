In case you haven't had the chance to use our website with your iPhone,
iPad, or Android phone, our website is responsive and scales beautifully.
If you're able to roam, we'd encourage you to consult our website for the
latest schedule information. One limitation of our website though, is our
ability to reach you. It's not quite as interactive as an experience as
we would like.

Rather than spend time and resources developing our own app, we've teamed up
with Berlin-based startup, [Oleapark](http://oleapark.com/).

Each new event you attend doesn't need a separate app. Instead each event in
OleaPark exists within a context called a "badge".
When you're in a particular context (or have a badge displayed), you receive
push notifications for that event, and can interact in a number of other ways.

Not only can we send you push notifications to keep you up-to-date with any
schedule changes or new _siesta-break_ activities, you can also use OleaPark
to find other participants that you might be interested in meeting. OleaPark
can even show you others with similar interests, based on Twitter and other
social network data.
