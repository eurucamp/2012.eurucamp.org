# Main Ticket Sale is Over: Last Minute tickets

You will have from [our][tweet1] [tweets][tweet2] that the main registration period for eurucamp and JRubyConf EU ended at **Monday, 31 July at 12 noon CEST**. Given we have multiple tracks on Friday, this gives us time  to make sure we can accommodate everyone comfortably at our venue (not to mention, feed and water).

We are planning to release a small batch of **Last Minute** tickets. These will be available from **5pm CEST** on **Friday 3 August**. More details (including exact prices*) will be posted during the course of this week.

Registration for our free, **Beginners' workshops**, organised in conjunction with our sister association, [Rails Girls Berlin][rgb], will also open on Friday at 5pm.

<sup>* As you may suspect, Last Minute tickets will be more expensive than our main batch – but still eminently affordable.</sup>
