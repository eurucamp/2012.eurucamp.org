The saddest thing about conferences is that they all cost money and ticket sales rarely cover all the expenses. This is especially true for eurucamp - as an inclusive conference, we try to keep ticket prices as low as possible. We try to give everyone the chance to participate in our event as part of the Ruby community, whether professionals or keen amateurs and regardless of financial  circumstances. We know that we may never meet this goal fully, but we try to come as close as possible.

This is where sponsors come in - companies and individuals kind enough to give us the means to provide our guests with the greatest experience possible. There are many ways you can sponsor eurucamp, the most direct is money. You can find all details about sponsoring eurucamp monetarily on our [sponsorship page](/sponsors "Sponsors"). These levels are intended for corporate sponsorship. If these 3 default options do not suit you (e.g. you want to sponsor us as an individual), we are open to other models of sponsorship. Please contact us at sponsor at eurucamp dot org to find out what else we have to offer.

So far we have only mentioned traditional sponsorship. However, there are other opportunities for getting involved in eurucamp. As the conference will be held in high summer at a lake, we don't want to keep you inside all day. That's why we are going to have a long lunch break on Saturday. This is the perfect opportunity for some activities around the lake, e.g. boating or hiking. If you feel like organizing such an activity for a number of attendees, please get in touch with us and we will find a way to feature you properly. Most likely, this is only for you if you are Berlin-based.

If you're strapped for cash, the simplest way of helping us is free. If you know anyone who wants to sponsor eurucamp, please send them our [sponsorship page](/sponsors "Sponsors") and retweet the announcement of this blog post.

Thank you all,
